        <h1>Matti Nykänen</h1>

         <p>
            
            Matti Ensio Nykänen 17 July 1963 – 4 February 2019) was a Finnish
            ski jumper who competed from 1981 to 1991. He is one of the most successful ski jumpers of all time,
            having won five Winter Olympic medals (four gold), nine World Championship medals (five gold), and 22
            Finnish Championship medals (14 gold). Most notably, he won three gold medals at the 1988 Winter
            Olympics, becoming, along with Yvonne van Gennip of the Netherlands, the most medaled athlete that winter.
            Nykänen is the only ski jumper in history to have won all five of the sport's major events: a gold medal at
            the Winter Olympics (three times), the Ski Jumping World Championships (once), the Ski Flying World
            Championships (once), four World Cup overall titles, and the Four Hills Tournament (twice). His four World
            Cup titles is an all-time male record shared with Adam Małysz. Nykänen remains the only male five-time ski
            flying world record holder in history.
            From the 1990s onwards, Nykänen's status as a celebrity was mainly fueled by his personal relationships, his
            career as a pop singer, and various incidents often related to heavy use of alcohol and violent behaviour.
            He was sentenced to 26 months in prison following a stabbing incident in 2004, and again for 16 months
            following an aggravated assault on his wife in 2009.

            For most of the 1980s, Nykänen and Jens Weißflog of East Germany dominated the sport. Nykänen won gold and
            silver at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. His 17.5-point gold medal victory was the largest margin of
            victory in Olympic ski jumping history at the time. He was also the first ever to win gold
            medals on both hills at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.
            In 1985 he flew 191 metres in Planica, a world record that stood briefly until Piotr Fijas (Poland) flew 194
            metres, again in Planica, in 1987. His other achievements include a total of nine medals
            (five golds) at the World Championship level. He also won a total of 46 World Cup
            competitions (only now topped by the current record-holder Gregor Schlierenzauer, Austria) and won the
            overall title four times (also a record, currently shared with Adam Małysz Poland).
            He won the prestigious Four Hills Tournament twice. He competed in the FIS Ski Flying World Championships
            five times and placed in the medals every time. Nykänen also won the ski jumping competition at the
            Holmenkollen ski festival twice (1982, 1985). In 1987, Nykänen was awarded the Holmenkollen Medal (shared
            with Hermann Weinbuch).
            On 28 February 2008, he won the International Masters Championship for veteran ski jumpers.
